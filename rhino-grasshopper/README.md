# Rhino and Grasshopper 3D Model and Code for Acoustic Simulation

This repository contains a Rhino 3D model and Grasshopper code for simulating acoustic properties of a space.

## Requirements

- [Rhino 3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/)
- Grasshopper (included in Rhino 3D)
- [Pachyderm Acoustical Simulation Grasshopper plugin](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/pachyderm-acoustical-simulation)
- [Paneling Tools Grasshopper plugin](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/panelingtools-rhino-and-grasshopper)

## Usage

1. Open the Rhino file acoustic_model.3dm.
2. In Grasshopper, open the file acoustic_simulation.gh.
3. Set the simulation parameters in the Grasshopper component.
4. Run the simulation in Grasshopper.
