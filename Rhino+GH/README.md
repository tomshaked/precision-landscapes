# Rhino and Grasshopper 3D Model and Code for Acoustic Simulation

This repository contains a Rhino 3D model and Grasshopper code for simulating acoustic properties of a space.

# Requirements

    [Rhino 3D (version 6 or later)](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/)
    Grasshopper (included in Rhino 3D)
    [Pachyderm Acoustical Simulation Grasshopper plugin](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/pachyderm-acoustical-simulation)
    [Paneling Tools Grasshopper plugin](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/panelingtools-rhino-and-grasshopper)

# Usage

    Open the Rhino file acoustic_model.3dm.
    In Grasshopper, open the file acoustic_simulation.gh.
    Set the simulation parameters in the Grasshopper component.
    Run the simulation in Grasshopper.
