# Introduction

This repository contains materials and files to support the course "Acoustic Grounds Winter Workshop".

# Course Overview
The course focuses on exploring the use of digital tools for designing acoustic grounds to mitigate noise pollution. The course is structured into three thematic sections, including analyzing noise and understanding noise landscapes, exploring/testing different conditions and designs, and assessment and comparative analysis.

The course will be conducted in a hybrid of online/in-person meetings for the first few days, followed by physical meetings in Munich. The course work will be undertaken in groups, and the final work will be presented in a presentation and booklet format.
